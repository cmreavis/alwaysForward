# alwaysForward

Always Forward is the final project for my coding bootcamp in the form of an ASP.NET Core Web app.\
the idea is to create a habit tracker/daily task application that contains functions I would want in my ideal app\
as well as mindfulness/therapeutic elements that I am interested in.

# functionality
ability to create tasks for daily use, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed\
reflected in MySQL database.

# future plans, ideas
user logins, sign in w/ Apple, Google, Meta, etc\
integrating daily affirmations/gratitude journaling\
heatmap of activity throughout the month (similar to github commit heatmap design)\
completed task streak\
week, month, yearly views\
rpg game elements
